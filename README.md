Assignment 06: Natural-Language Date Parser

In this week's lectures, we saw tools such as pytest, mypy, and ruff that help us write good code. We also saw a demonstration of coding agents, and how these tools (pytest in particular) play a role in what we called the "middle path" workflow for developing software with AI, where we (the human) write a precise specification in the form of a test suite, and the AI fills in the implementation.

In this assignment, you'll use this workflow to build a small Python library called nldate that turns natural-language date strings — things like "5 days before December 1st, 2025", and "next Tuesday" — into concrete dates.

This is a place where the "middle path" workflow shines. The tests are easy and quick to write, since it is straightforward to specify the expected output for a given input. The implementation, on the other hand, is tricky to write by hand. There are a lot of corner cases and branches to get right, and it's easy to make a small mistake. In the "middle path", we let the AI agent handle the implementation, and the test cases will serve as guardrails to ensure it gets the right answer.
The Scenario

You've just starting working at a company whose main product is a calendar app. The CEO has caught the AI bug, and they want to see AI features added to the app. "Users should be able to write a date in English, like 'two weeks from tomorrow' and have the AI figure out what date they mean," they tell your project manager. Your project manager, though, is smart: they realize that "AI" (in the form of an LLM or similar) is overkill for a task like this (and an expensive overkill at that). Rather, some basic pattern matching is all you need.

Your PM sends you an email at 4:30 pm on Friday afternoon laying out the task.

    Hey UCSD DSC graduate,

    We need to get some natural date parsing into the calendar app ASAP so we can stay front-footed on the AI trend.

    Could you write up a Python package that takes in a natural language date, like "5 days before December 1st, 2025", "1 year and 2 months after yesterday", or "next Tuesday", and returns a datetime.date object?

    Please have it in my queue for review by the open of business on Monday.

    Thanks! Have a good weekend!

    Sincerely, Boss

Your boss then stops by your desk before they leave the office and fill in some details. They are expecting you to write a Python package named nldate that has a parse() function with the following signature:

from datetime import date

def parse(s: str, today: date | None = None) -> date:
    ...

Given a natural language date, like "5 days before December 1st, 2025" or "next Tuesday", the parse() function should return a datetime.date object representing the date that the input string refers to. The today parameter is used as a reference point for relative date expressions (like "next Tuesday" or "in 3 days"). If today is not provided, it should default to the current date.

You ask your boss: "what, exactly, can the input look like? Can you give me a list of all the different formats I need to support?" They say: "Sorry, I don't have time to write up a spec right now. Can you just make it work for the most common kinds of input you can think of? I'm sure you'll figure it out! If you send me a working implementation over the weekend, I'll test it on a bunch of inputs and let you know what to add support for."
Requirements

    You should implement your code in a public GitHub repository.
    Your project should be a Python project managed with uv.
    Your project should contain a tests/ directory containing a pytest test suite with at least 10 tests. All tests must pass.
    mypy and ruff should pass with no errors on your codebase.

The Autograder

Submit to the autograder a single file named repo_url.txt containing the URL of your GitHub repository. Make sure that your repo is public, as otherwise the autograder won't be able to access it.

The autograder for this assignment will clone your repository and check that the above requirements are met. It will also test your parse() function on a variety of inputs. However, as soon as one of the test cases fails, the autograder will stop and report that failure without proceeding, similar to what your boss would do in real life when they are testing your implementation. Because of this, you should start by writing a date parser that is very general and accepts a wide variety of date formats -- not just those that your boss specified in their original email.

All of the autograder's tests are public, so if you pass all of them, you will get full credit on this assignment.
